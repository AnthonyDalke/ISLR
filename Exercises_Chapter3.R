# 1.) All the predictor variables except NEWSPAPER have statistically significant effects on the model.
# In other words, holding the other variables constant, each variable helps explain the relationship between
# the predictor and dependent variables.

# 3.) a.) The interaction variable between GPA and gender makes the difference here: for a high enough female
# GPA, the negative coefficient pushes the predicted salary below that of a male, so "iii".
# b.)
50 + (20 * 4) + (0.07 * 110) + 35 + (0.01 * 110 * 4) - (10 * 4)
# c.) False - the deciding piece of information concerns the variable's p-value, not simply its coefficient.

# 4.) a.) Because the data set has a linear relationship, the linear model should have a lower RSS
# b.) Since higher-dimension models have a tendency to overfit on training data, the linear model should
# have a lower RSS
# c.) In this case, the cubic model should have a lower RSS, because its higher dimensions should enable
# it to capture the non-linear relationship in the data
# d.) Again, since higher-dimension models tend to overfit, the linear model should have a lower RSS

# 5.) a-prime reflects the product of fitted x values and the accompanying point's derivative (slope)

# 6.) Since linear regression aims to minimize the distance between fitted values and x-bar and y-bar,
# it will strive to come as close as possible to (x-bar, y-bar).

# 7.) Both the linear regression and correlational coefficient formulas depend on the distance between
# fitted values and the averages of x and y.
